    mass
        The mass of the samples.  Dry mass is mandatory, either by supplying it directly, or by back-calculation
        from wet mass and H2O.  Without dry mass composition cannot be managed, since composition is on a dry basis.

    composition
        The composition of the DRY mass.  Typically chemical composition is of interest (elements and oxides), however mineral composition is/will be supported.
