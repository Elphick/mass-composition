The package is pip instalable.

..  code-block::

    pip install mass-composition

If you want the extras (for visualisation) you'll install like this with pip.

.. code-block::

    pip install mass-composition -e ".[viz]"

Or, if poetry is more your flavour.

..  code-block::

    poetry add mass-composition

or with extras...

..  code-block::

    poetry add "mass-composition[viz]"
